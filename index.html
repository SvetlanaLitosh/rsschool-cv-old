        <section class="about">
            <p>I attended the Belarusian State University of Transport 
                Electrotehnical faculty in 2009.</p>
            <p>Having started my career as Insurance Sales Agent in a 
                Belrosstrakh with minimum skills, I became proficient 
                in Insurance Sales. My keen interest in Insurance 
                Sales technologies led me to working as a Team Lead 
                Manager. In 2015, I quit my job,because my first child
                 was born, in 2018 my second child was born.</p>
            <p>Two years ago Iâ€™ve become passionate about Front-end . 
                All my extra free time, I spend learning Frontend 
                Development.I am interested in web development, because
                 this occupation provides endless opportunities for 
                 professional growth,in addition, it is possible to work
                  remotely.</p>
